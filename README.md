# Welcome!

This is the repository for the workshop "Introduction to Quantum Machine Learning". We are putting the finishing touches on the project that will be used in the workshop; please check back on or after **November 7th** to get the latest version of the project.

## While you're waiting

To work on this tutorial, you'll need to install the [Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum), available for Windows 10, macOS, and for Linux.
Please see the [install guide for the Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/install-guide/) for the detailed instructions. We recommend that you use Visual Studio 2017 or Visual Studio Code.

To improve your experience in the workshop, we suggest you to go through the BasicGates kata from the [Quantum Katas](https://github.com/Microsoft/QuantumKatas) project. 
It teaches you the basic gates used in quantum computing and helps you get more comfortable with Q#. 
Superposition and Measurement katas are the next best introductory topics.
